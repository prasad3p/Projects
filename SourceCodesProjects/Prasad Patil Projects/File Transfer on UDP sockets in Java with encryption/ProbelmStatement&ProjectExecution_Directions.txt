The prime goal of the project is to design a distributed networking JAVA application for 
effective communication between a client and server. The application should guarantee reliable 
data transfer between the two communicating parties. The application should employ JAVA’s UDP socket 
and provide reliable data transfer functionality on top of UDP’s unreliable communication services by 
implementing Integrity Checksum. This Integrity Checksum will authenticate and authorize communication 
access for both the client and server. The protocol will use integrity check, timeout and retransmission, 
which are required for successful communication between the client and server.
The server should serve the following three text files to the client:  
•	directors_message.txt
•	program_overview.txt
•	scholarly_paper.txt
The messages exchanged between the client and server should be text-oriented and consist of human 
readable character sequences. To calculate the integrity check value at client, the character sequence
should be converted to a sequence of 16-bit words. Each 16-bit word should contain ASCII codes for two 
consecutive message characters. The final calculated 16-bit word is the checksum value. Similarly, the 
same procedure should be carried out at the server and the integrity checksum value should be recalculated. 
Then, the computed integrity checksum value and the received integrity checksum value should be compared. 
If they don’t match, then there are some errors in the received message that is, integrity check has failed.

Opening java files in eclipse:

- Create a new java project in eclipse.
- Right click on the 'src' folder of the pakcage created.
- Click on 'Import', select 'general', select 'file system'
- Browse the folder where java files are stored.
- Select the java files to be imported
- Click on finish.
- Delete packages defined in the code if there are any. Let the code run in default package of project created.
- Execute.

===================================================================================

Code execution

- To set the path where the text files are stored in the local system, 
- Open the Server.java source code. 
- In the method getFIleContent( ) of Server class set the path in the field named 'pathl'.

===================================================================================

Special characters

- The code assumes that there are no apostrophe ( ' ) or double quotes ( " " ) in the text files whose content is to be transmitted.
- Care should be taken to remove all the apostrophe and double quotes from the text files.
